Web Dev Challenge 01

Create a 4-page "Palm Pizza" website with at least two related images on every webpage. 

One of the images on each page must be the logo/icon (at the top left corner). 

The other image should be some related image of a pizza. 

An h1 on each page shows the main title or heading of that page. 

An h2 is used to give more info about the larger image

Your website must have a working navigation system allowing users to easily
go back and forth from every page to every other page on the website.

Each HTML page of your website must have some working CSS linked to the styles.css file.

For extra credit: 
1) the logo/icon should be a link taking you back to the Home page.
2) all your images are inside of an images folder

Your website must include: 

HTML: 
 - 4 HTML files named: index.html, pepperoni.html, veggie.html, cheese.html
 - each HTML page starts out with basic setup: DOCTYPE, html, head, body
 - in the head element, include a title tag with title: "Palm Pizza"
 - every HTML page has a link to styles.css with the link tag. Where does it go? What about the href?
 - every HTML page has at least these tags: h1, h2, p
 - every HTML page has at least two images. Tag: img

CSS: 
 - 1 CSS file named: styles.css
 - use an html selector with font-family: sans-serif; and font-size: 20px;
 - all h1 text should be have color: red
 - all h2 text should be have color: blue
 - all p text should have color: green

 Paragraph ideas...
 (you could use these for your p tags, but you don't have to)

 Pepperoni: Is pepperoni the world's most popular pizza?!
 Cheese: The more cheese the better?
 Veggie: Are veggie pizzas more healthy?
